##################################

# Configuration Notes:
# * The code in this file is run in a limited environment. Functions like 
#   'eval', 'exit', and 'exec' aren't permitted. 
# * The order of precedence for treadmill settings from least to final is:
#   defaults -> treadmill.conf -> profile -> command line.


# Here you speficy the number of each operation type to run per thread per iteration.
# Each thread will generate a randomized list of these operations and cycle through it 
# until an exit condition occurs.
#
# Note: 
# * Each add will cause a coresponding delete(or two, see next line). 
# * A cleanup is done when an exit condition occurs. This results in a delete operation
#   for each add. Currently, this is done for all generated DNs reguardless of if they've 
#   already been deleted that iteration. I'm planning to change this in the future. 
#

my %profile = (
	search	=> 100,

# Here is a chance to override options from the config file but not the command line.
# 'duration' and 'threads' are likely to be of the greatest interest. 
my %extra_options = (
	threads		=> 1,
	duration	=> 0,
);

# Do not edit this line.
