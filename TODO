Short and long term goals for the LDAP Treadmill. 

General:
- Add GUI
- Destructive mods/deletes.
- Proofread and complete perldoc.
- Ability to give each thread it's own profile.
- Save derived op sets or stats for a  faster init.
- Option to control which op types are smartgened. 
- More behaviors. Such as:
  - 'bad behavior'
  - open connection, bind, send op, drop.
  - malformed filters
  - unindexed searches (detection?)

Code Improvement:
- Figure out a more sensible constants and error handling scheme. 
- Divide out smartgen code into threads with separate ldap connections. 
  I.E. Searching for bind creds. 
- Re-arrange functions to have a more logical grouping in file. 
- Exclude objectClass from search attrs. (or not?)
- Take a look at the input checking since args and settings have changed.
- only try to delete existing DNs on cleanup.
- Add infinite loop protection for Rand_Arr. See comments. 


Needs Testing:
- Stats LDIF and LDAP errors
- App Doesn't err on non-existent LDIF file.
