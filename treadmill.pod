             [--threads num] [--config file] [--profile file]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

 The LDAP Treadmill is a simple perl application that will run a defined set of 
 operations on a server for a interval or pending CTRL-C. 
 
 One may also: 
  - Specify multiple threads. One connection per thread.
  - Specify additional operation sets and coresponding settings as profiles
  - Automatically generate more pertinent operation parameters by examining the 
    server or parsing an LDIF backup.

=head1 OPTIONS

 -H ldapuri The LDAP server URI to connect to.

 -D binddn The DN used for server authentication.

 -w passwd The password used for server authentication.

 --help Print out a brief usage statement.

 --threads num The number of threads to launch. Each thread generates a
   somewhat randomized set of operations which it loops until interrupted.

 --config file Allows one to specify an alternate configuration file.

 --profile file Allows one to specify an alternate profile file.

 --smartgen Instructs treadmill to connect to LDAP and read a subset of entries 
   used to accumulate some statistics and information for more relevant operation 
   generation. 

   If -f is used an LDIF file may be substituted which is usually faster.
 
 -f file An ldif file to be substituted for the LDAP server in association with 
    --smartgen

 --duration seconds Tell treadmill to exit after a set interval of activity. Zero
   indicates no limit. 

=head1 CONFIGURATION

 There are four prioritized sources of configuration. Settings will be read from 
 these sources in order with each successive source taking precedence. 

 1. threadmill.pl      - Hardcoded defaults. 
 2. treadmill.conf     - The main configuration file. 
 3. treadmill profiles - more specific configuration.
 4. Command line Opts  - The final authority.

 * For more detailed configuration documentation see: TODO
